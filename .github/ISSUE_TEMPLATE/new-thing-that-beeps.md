Do you have a new thing that beeps? Great!

If you're feeling ambitious, you can contribute it yourself, by doing the following:

1. Fork this repository.
2. If you have a new product category beyond the existing ones, make a new folder in the root of this repository with a short name to describe it.
3. Add a new item to the relevant product category folder (e.g. `fan/` or `ups/`), by copying the existing `.md` files as templates and changing the relevant content blocks -- "Does it Beep?", "Photo," "Can you make it stop?", and "Link to purchase." This last one is going to have my own Amazon referral link ID inserted into it, so I can sustain my hobby of documenting things that beep; I can change it in your pull request.
4. Open the pull request!

If that seems intimidating, no problem, just provide that same data via this form instead, and I'll take care of the rest.

Thank you for documenting this beeping.
